# Post-Session Learning Validation - Core Tools Project

## Purpose
This validation system helps sessions discover context gaps and improve the memory system. It's a **learning experience**, not just a checklist.

## Instructions for New Session

After running the memory primer from SESSION_HANDOFF.md, work through this validation to:
1. **Identify what context you actually have**
2. **Discover what context you're missing**
3. **Learn how to improve the memory system**

## Validation Categories

### 1. Constitutional Rules Context
**What you should know:**
- The word 'curl' is absolutely forbidden in any bash command
- You must be in `/Users/coreyryan/data/mashh/core-tools` (project root)
- Tools `curl.sh`, `test_server`, `spin.toml` must exist and be verified
- Global rules always override task convenience

**If you don't have this context:**
- Your memory primer queries may be insufficient
- The Project Constitution entity may need updates
- SESSION_HANDOFF.md constitutional rules section may be incomplete
- Consider: Are the constitutional rules prominent enough in the breadcrumb trail?

### 2. Proactive Self-Improvement Context
**What you should know:**
- You should scan every command before execution for prohibited patterns
- You should verify location and tools before any operation
- You should check memory entity discoverability before creating new ones
- You should self-monitor pattern adherence every 5-10 actions

**If you don't have this context:**
- The proactive pattern recognition system may not be discoverable
- Self-improvement triggers may not be connected to constitutional rules
- SESSION_HANDOFF.md may need stronger emphasis on proactive behavior
- Consider: Is self-improvement treated as fundamental as constitutional rules?

### 3. Current Project Status Context
**What you should know:**
- Branch: `feat/core-tools`
- Overall progress: ~70% complete
- SEGMENT 8 (Math3D): 100% complete (23 tools)
- SEGMENT 9 (Statistics): 45% complete (5 of 11 tools)
- Architecture: 100% consistent (all tools use FTL-SDK pattern)

**If you don't have this context:**
- Migration status tracking may be fragmented
- Project memory entities may need updates
- SESSION_HANDOFF.md current status section may be stale
- Consider: Is project progress being maintained systematically?

### 4. Immediate Technical Context
**What you should know:**
- Server restarted with correlation tools (recent PID)
- 3 correlation tools built and configured: pearson_correlation, spearman_correlation, correlation_matrix
- curl.sh updated with correlation tests
- Next priority: Test correlation tools, then continue statistics migration

**If you don't have this context:**
- SESSION_HANDOFF.md may not reflect latest work
- Recent accomplishments may not be documented in memory
- Technical state may not be captured adequately
- Consider: Are we maintaining current technical state effectively?

### 5. Operational Command Context
**What you should know:**
- Testing: `./curl.sh` (never curl directly)
- Server management: `./test_server restart|stop|status`
- Build process: `cd tools/[category]/[tool] && cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release`
- Location verification: `pwd` should show project root

**If you don't have this context:**
- Operational procedures may not be discoverable through memory primer
- Command patterns may not be well-documented
- Project-specific workflows may be unclear
- Consider: Are operational procedures as prominent as constitutional rules?

## Learning Exercise

For each category where you lack context, ask yourself:

1. **Why is this context missing?**
   - Are the memory queries insufficient?
   - Are the entities not well-connected?
   - Is the breadcrumb trail incomplete?

2. **How can the memory system be improved?**
   - What entities need updates?
   - What relations need to be created?
   - What should be added to SESSION_HANDOFF.md?

3. **What patterns does this reveal?**
   - Are there systematic gaps in our memory approach?
   - Are we prioritizing the right information?
   - Are we making information discoverable enough?

## Memory System Improvement Actions

Based on your validation results, consider these improvements:

### If Constitutional Rules are unclear:
- Update Project Constitution entity with clearer observations
- Enhance SESSION_HANDOFF.md constitutional rules section
- Create stronger relations between constitutional rules and other entities

### If Proactive Self-Improvement is missing:
- Add proactive pattern recognition to memory primer queries
- Create stronger connections between self-improvement and constitutional rules
- Emphasize prevention over remediation in SESSION_HANDOFF.md

### If Project Status is unclear:
- Update migration status entities in project memory
- Refresh SESSION_HANDOFF.md current status section
- Create better tracking of project progress

### If Technical Context is missing:
- Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md with latest technical state
- Document recent accomplishments in memory
- Ensure technical context is preserved between sessions

### If Operational Commands are unclear:
- Add operational procedure entities to memory
- Create command pattern library in memory
- Enhance SESSION_HANDOFF.md operational sections

## Validation Output

After completing this validation, provide:

1. **Context Assessment**: What context you have/lack
2. **Gap Analysis**: Why information might be missing
3. **Improvement Recommendations**: Specific memory system enhancements
4. **Pattern Recognition**: What this reveals about our memory approach

## Example Validation Response

```
VALIDATION RESULTS:

✅ Constitutional Rules: Clear - absolute curl prohibition understood
❌ Proactive Self-Improvement: Missing - didn't find pattern recognition system
✅ Project Status: Clear - understand current migration progress
❌ Technical Context: Partial - unclear about server status and recent work
✅ Operational Commands: Clear - understand available tools

GAP ANALYSIS:
- Proactive self-improvement entities may not be connected to constitutional rules
- Technical state documentation may be stale in SESSION_HANDOFF.md
- Recent work may not be captured in memory adequately

IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add proactive pattern recognition to memory primer queries
2. Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md technical state section
3. Create better relations between self-improvement and constitutional rules

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
- Constitutional rules are working well (discoverable)
- Technical state preservation needs improvement
- Self-improvement system needs better integration
```

## Next Steps

After validation, use your findings to:
1. **Update memory entities** to fill gaps
2. **Enhance SESSION_HANDOFF.md** with missing information
3. **Create better relations** between disconnected concepts
4. **Improve the breadcrumb trail** for future sessions

Remember: This is a **learning system** - use it to make the memory framework better for future sessions.
