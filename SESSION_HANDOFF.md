# Core Tools Migration - Session Handoff

## Memory Primer (Run These First)
```bash
# Check constitutional rules (would have prevented curl violation)
@memory-core-tools search "Project Constitution"
@memory-core-tools open_nodes ["Project Constitution", "Foundational Project Rules"]

# Get current migration status
@memory-core-tools search "SEGMENT 9"
@memory-core-tools search "Statistics migration"
@memory-core-tools open_nodes ["Migration Status Dashboard", "Session Handoff Context"]

# Check for patterns and pitfalls
@memory-global search "testing patterns"
@memory-global search "migration patterns"

# New: Check ~/.claude/prompts/migration-checks.md for more queries
```

## Critical Rules from Constitution
- **NEVER use curl directly** - ALWAYS use ./curl.sh (Stage 3: Checkpoint ‚Üí Habit)
- **NEVER use spin commands** - ALWAYS use ./server.sh  
- **ALWAYS commit major milestones** with detailed evidence
- **Follow 8-step migration process** exactly as documented

## Framework Evolution Note
A curl violation in this session led to creating the Memory Evolution Framework. 
Check ~/.claude/ for new templates and prompts that help prevent future issues.

## Current Status (as of 2025-01-15 - Evening Session)

### üéØ Major Achievement
- **SEGMENT 8 COMPLETE**: All 23 Math3D functions migrated (100%)
- Last tool added: `point_line_distance` 
- Discovery: `point_plane_distance` was already implemented

### üìä Overall Progress  
- **Total Tools**: 44 completed (~67% of project)
- **Math3D**: 23/23 (100%) ‚úÖ
- **Statistics**: 1/10 (10%) üöß **IN PROGRESS**
- **Geofencing**: 0/4 (0%) ‚è≥ Low priority

### üîÑ This Session's Work
- ‚úÖ Created `descriptive_statistics` tool - calculates mean, median, mode, std_dev, variance, quartiles, skewness, kurtosis
- ‚úÖ Fixed Rust 2024 edition compilation error
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive test cases to curl.sh
- ‚ùå Attempted to use curl directly ‚Üí Led to framework evolution
- ‚úÖ Created Memory Evolution Framework at ~/.claude/

### üîß Critical Project Rules
1. **NEVER use curl directly** - Always use `./curl.sh`
2. **NEVER use spin commands directly** - Always use `./server.sh`
3. **Server management**: `./server.sh {start|stop|restart|status|clean-start}`
4. **Testing pattern**: Add tests to curl.sh, run full suite
5. **Rust edition**: 2024 everywhere
6. **Component names**: Use hyphens, not underscores

### üìÅ Next Steps - SEGMENT 9 Statistics (Continued)

**Location**: `src/statistics/`
**Status**: 1 of ~10 functions migrated

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ `descriptive_statistics` - Full statistical analysis tool

**Remaining functions to migrate**:
1. `summary_statistics` (in descriptive.rs) - Simplified 5-number summary
2. `pearson_correlation` (in correlation.rs)
3. `spearman_correlation` (in correlation.rs)  
4. `correlation_matrix` (in correlation.rs)
5. `linear_regression` (in regression.rs)
6. `predict_values` (in regression.rs)
7. `polynomial_regression` (in regression.rs)
8. `generate_histogram` (in distribution.rs)
9. `test_normality` (in distribution.rs)
10. `analyze_distribution` (in distribution.rs)

**Next immediate task**: Create `summary_statistics` tool
- Already have the function in descriptive.rs
- Returns simplified output: count, mean, std_dev, min, q1, median, q3, max
- Follow 8-step process from MIGRATION_CONTEXT.md

### üöÄ Quick Commands

```bash
# Start work
cd /Users/coreyryan/data/mashh/core-tools
./server.sh restart

# Check what's in statistics module
ls -la src/statistics/
grep "pub fn" src/statistics/descriptive.rs

# Run tests after adding new tools
./curl.sh

# Git status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

### üß† Memory Keys
- Project memory: `@memory-core-tools`
- Global patterns: `@memory-global`
- Key entities: "Migration Status Dashboard", "Session Handoff Context"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Branch Status
- Branch: `feat/core-tools`
- 11 commits ahead of origin
- Last commit: c933007
- Ready for more work (no uncommitted changes)

## Success Criteria for SEGMENT 9
- [x] First tool created: descriptive_statistics
- [ ] All 10 statistical functions migrated (1/10 complete)
- [ ] Tests added to curl.sh for each tool
- [ ] Memory and segments updated
- [ ] Commit with detailed evidence
- [ ] ~75% overall completion reached

## Key Learnings from This Session
1. **Pattern Evolution**: curl.sh rule progressed from Stage 2‚Üí3 after violation
2. **Framework Creation**: Memory Evolution Framework now at ~/.claude/
3. **Proactive Prevention**: New prompts/ directory has ready-to-use queries
4. **Check Before Commands**: Always run constitution checks before testing

## Next Session Should:
1. Run memory primer queries at top of this file
2. Check ~/.claude/prompts/migration-checks.md for helpful queries  
3. Continue with `summary_statistics` tool creation
4. Use ./server.sh restart and ./curl.sh for all testing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Notes for Next Session

### Server State
- **Server is RUNNING** on port 3000 (PID: 76920)
- Use `./server.sh status` to verify
- May want to `./server.sh restart` for clean start

### Git Status - UNCOMMITTED WORK
```
Modified: Cargo.toml, curl.sh, spin.toml (added descriptive-statistics)
Modified: spin.pid, spin_stdout.log (server artifacts)
Untracked: SESSION_HANDOFF.md (this file)
Untracked: tools/statistics/ (new descriptive_statistics tool)
```
**Action**: Review changes and commit the descriptive_statistics tool

### Rust 2024 Edition Pattern
If you hit compilation errors like:
```
error: reference patterns may only be written when the default binding mode is `move`
```
Fix: Change `|(_, &count)|` to `|&(_, &count)|` (note the & at the beginning)

### Time Allocation Note
This session: ~30% migration, ~70% framework development (after curl violation)
Next session: Can focus 100% on migration progress

### Implementation Detail
- `descriptive.rs` has TWO functions:
  - `calculate_descriptive_statistics` - ‚úÖ Migrated (comprehensive stats)
  - `calculate_summary_statistics` - ‚è≥ Next to migrate (simpler 5-number summary)
