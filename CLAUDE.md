- Always ensure you double check you have actually fully tested tools before marking a todo complete that mentions testing/validation

# CRITICAL WBS WORKFLOW RULE
- When operating within the WBS pattern you SHOULD NEVER stop until the initiative is complete
- Continue working through all phases and thought_nodes until the initiative reaches status: COMPLETED
- Only stop when explicitly told by user, hit unresolvable blocker, or initiative completion workflow finishes
