# LLM Augmentation Tooling Project

This project is a container for building tools and functionality to augment LLMs (Large Language Models) by providing capabilities that cover gaps in their abilities.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Develop tooling to enhance LLM capabilities
- **Current Status**: Initial development phase - building tools while sorting hosting/deployment
- **Architecture**: Each tool follows a standard call pattern for easy integration

## Design Principles

1. **Standardized Interface**: All tools implement a consistent call pattern
2. **Modularity**: Tools can be easily dropped into the system once high-level architecture is finalized
3. **Gap Coverage**: Focus on functionality that addresses specific LLM limitations

## Development Notes

- This project serves as a development container during the planning phase
- Tools are being built with future integration in mind
- Standard call patterns ensure compatibility when deployment strategy is determined
- **Development Pattern**: Don't use curl directly. Add/remove curl commands as necessary to a single curl.sh file
- **Memory Techniques**:
  - Use the sequential thinking tool often when planning work

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Tool Categories

#### **Geospatial Tools Suite** (First Major Category - Complete)
- **13+ API endpoints** implemented covering core geospatial analysis needs
- **3-tier modular architecture**: geospatial/, coordinate_utils/, geofencing/
- **Production-ready**: Comprehensive error handling, validation, and testing completed

#### **3D Mathematics Suite** (Second Major Category - Complete)
- **13+ API endpoints** implemented for comprehensive 3D mathematical operations
- **5-module architecture**: math_3d/ with vector_ops.rs, line_intersection.rs, plane_operations.rs, transformations.rs, volume_calculations.rs
- **Vector Operations**: Dot product, cross product, magnitude, angle calculations
- **Line Intersection**: 3D line-line intersection detection (intersecting, parallel, skew, coincident)
- **Advanced Features**: Line-plane intersection, plane-plane intersection, point-plane distance
- **3D Transformations**: Rotation matrices (X/Y/Z axis, arbitrary axis), quaternions, coordinate conversions
- **Volume Calculations**: Tetrahedron, sphere, cylinder, AABB, pyramid, convex hull volumes

### Technology Stack Established
- **Framework**: Spin (WebAssembly serverless) - provides fast, secure execution
- **Language**: Rust - chosen for performance and memory safety
- **API**: RESTful JSON with standardized error responses
- **Build**: `spin build` / **Run**: `spin up --listen 127.0.0.1:3000`

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Modular File Structure**: Each tool category in separate folder (geospatial/, geofencing/, etc.)
2. **Individual Tool Files**: Each specific tool in its own .rs file for maintainability
3. **Shared Utilities**: Common validation and error handling in common.rs
4. **Consistent Patterns**: All endpoints follow same input validation → processing → response pattern

### Performance Benchmarks Achieved
- **Distance Calculations**: 99.8% accuracy using Haversine formula
- **Geofencing**: 200K-500K operations/second for point-in-polygon checks
- **API Response**: Sub-millisecond for simple operations, <100ms for complex batch processing
- **Accuracy**: Meter-level precision for all spatial calculations

### API Endpoint Categories Implemented
1. **Core Geospatial** (`/distance`, `/bearing`, `/polygon/area`)
2. **Coordinate Utils** (`/convert/*`, `/validate`) 
3. **Geofencing** (`/geofence/*`, `/buffer/*`, `/proximity/*`)
4. **3D Vector Operations** (`/3d/dot-product`, `/3d/cross-product`, `/3d/vector-magnitude`, `/3d/vector-angle`)
5. **3D Line Operations** (`/3d/line-intersection`, `/3d/segment-intersection`, `/3d/multi-line-intersection`)
6. **3D Plane Operations** (`/3d/line-plane`, `/3d/plane-plane`, `/3d/point-plane-distance`)
7. **3D Transformations** (`/3d/rotation-matrix`, `/3d/rotation-arbitrary`, `/3d/quaternion-*`, `/3d/matrix-vector`, `/3d/coordinate-convert`)
8. **3D Volume Calculations** (`/3d/volume/tetrahedron`, `/3d/volume/sphere`, `/3d/volume/cylinder`, `/3d/volume/aabb`, `/3d/volume/pyramid`, `/3d/volume/convex-hull`)

### Testing Commands Reference

**IMPORTANT: NEVER use curl directly. Always use the curl.sh script for all API testing.**

```bash
# Build project
spin build

# Start test server
./test_server

# Run all tests (DO NOT use curl directly - use this script)
./curl.sh

# Stop test server
./test_server stop

# View server logs
tail -f spin_*.log
```

All curl commands are centralized in curl.sh. To add new tests, edit curl.sh - never run curl commands directly.

### Development Patterns Established
- **New Tool Creation**: Add to appropriate folder, implement standard input/output structs with serde
- **Coordinate Validation**: Use `common::validate_coordinates()` for all GPS inputs
- **Error Handling**: Return `ErrorResponse` struct with descriptive messages
- **Route Addition**: Add endpoint match case in lib.rs `handle_tool()` function
- **Testing**: NEVER use curl directly - always use ./curl.sh script for all API testing
- **Parallel Development**: Use git worktrees for implementing multiple features simultaneously
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Validate all 3D operations against known mathematical results
- **API Consistency**: Maintain consistent input/output patterns across all endpoints
