# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-07-18] - Post-Migration Architecture Improvements

### Added
- **vector_analysis composite tool** - Comprehensive vector analysis demonstrating HTTP composition pattern
- **HTTP composition pattern** - Architecture now supports complex operations by combining atomic tools
- **Composition pattern documentation** - Clear guidelines for building composite tools

### Changed
- **MASSIVE ToolResponse Pattern Correction** - Systematically corrected 83 tools (97.3%) from Result<T, String> to proper FTL-SDK ToolResponse pattern
- **Extracted coordinate conversion tools** - Separated cartesian_to_cylindrical and cylindrical_to_cartesian from bundled tool
- **Updated README** - Added composition pattern documentation and architectural improvements section

### Technical Details
- **Scope**: 83 tools across 11 categories (math3d, statistics, basic_math, geospatial, encoding, etc.)
- **Pattern**: All tools now use `ToolResponse::text()` with proper error handling per FTL-SDK requirements
- **Architecture**: Established HTTP composition pattern for complex operations
- **Validation**: All tools compile successfully and maintain API compatibility

### Fixed
- **Pattern violations** - line_intersection tool pattern compliance
- **Bundling issues** - Extracted atomic coordinate conversion tools for better modularity
- **Documentation accuracy** - Corrected MIGRATION_CONTEXT.md with proper FTL-SDK patterns

This represents the largest systematic improvement in project history, correcting a fundamental pattern error affecting nearly every tool while establishing modern composition architecture.
